### On Deed to Domain

Welcome to **Ocurious · ocur.io**, a world inspired by the geocacher's trade and powered by **deed**, **domain**, and **artifact**.

In **Ocurious**, use an NFT as both,


- **deed** (*token*), to store in an *Ethereum-enabled* wallet and share/trade with others
- **domain** (*key*), to access a domain and build/sell **artifact**


Use **artifact** to store information such as datetime, location, text, along with images and files, to associate with the domain.

Upon transfer of the NFT (*deed domain*), both *domain access* and *domain artifact* are also transfered.
<br/><br/>
### Get Started

To begin, install a *web3-compliant* Ethereum wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and/or [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), then use the <i class="material-icons">account_balance_wallet</i> icon in the top-right corner to connect.

All deed domains and/or token balances will appear upon successful connection.

To purchase a deed domain, visit [OpenSea <i class="material-icons">sailing</i> ...](https://opensea.io/urland) to buy the NFT, then reconnect your wallet to see your domain.
