### On Deed to Domain

Enter **UR.Land**, a world inspired by adventure, to explore using a dApp fueled by *geocache* and the *explorer's trade*, all powered by the concept of a **deed domain NFT**, and the ERC-20 ETH token, **OCUR**.

<br/><br/>
The concept of a **deed domain NFT** is defined as using the *NFT* as,


- *deed*, token to store in a wallet to share/trade with others
- *domain*, key to access your domain to share/trade cards


Post content to add cards to your domain. Use text, images, files, location, datetimes, and more, to create interesting content.
<br/><br/>
A domain's content can only be added/edited/deleted by the owner of the **deed domain NFT** unless it is shared or traded. All posted content is public and can be viewed by anyone.

Upon transfer of the **NFT** to another wallet, both domain *access* and *content* are transfered to the new owner. 

No changes are made to any previously shared and traded content.
<br/><br/>
