### On Deed to Domain

Welcome to **OCUR â€¢ UR.Land**, a world inspired by adventure, made to explore using the only dApp fueled by *geocache* and the *explorer's trade*, all powered by the concept of **deed domain**, and **OCUR**, an ETH ERC-20 token.

<br/><br/>
The function of a **deed domain** is both,


- *deed*, a token to store in your wallet and share with others
- *domain*, a key to access the site and post/trade content


Post content to either your wallet address and/or *deed domain*. Use text, images, files, locations, and more, to create interesting content.
<br/><br/>
Content can only be changed by the owner of the wallet and/or *deed domain*. All content posted is public and can be viewed by anyone, all content traded to another wallet and/or *deed domain* is private, unless the recipient decides to make it public.

Upon transfer of the token to another wallet, both *deed domain* *access* and its *content* are also transfered to the new owner. 

<br/><br/>
### Get Started
