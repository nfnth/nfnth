### Build Domain

Use the gear icon <img src="res/img/gear/gear1.png" width="48" height="48" /> in the right-hand corner to open the **Wallet/Deck** menu, where you can view/change the status of your wallet and domains.

In this menu, you can view balances, post cards, trade **OCUR**, and check/send messages, etc.

For example, to post a card to a domain, select the domain, select the **Deck** tab, then press the **+** icon.


### How To Build Domain

The **domain** is both the location of the deed and where to find its listed artifact.

To build a **domain**, use the <span style="font-size:32px;">ðŸ¥š</span> icon to open the **Wallet** menu, then select **Connect** to view the status of your wallet and list the deeds you own.

Next, select a deed from the drop-down menu, and the options to **Build** and/or **Trade** will become enabled.

To switch between the *map*, *list*, and *artifact* view, use the <img src="res/img/gear/gear1.png" width="36" height="36" /> icon in the upper-right corner.
