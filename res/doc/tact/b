### Build Domain

Use the gear icon <img src="res/img/gear/gear1.png" width="48" height="48" /> in the right-hand corner to open the **Wallet/Deck** menu, where you can view/change the status of your wallet and domains.

In this menu, you can view balances, post cards, trade **OCUR**, and check/send messages, etc.

For example, to post a card to a domain, select the domain, select the **Deck** tab, then press the **+** icon.
