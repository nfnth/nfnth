### Post Deck

Use the **Editor** to create cards with datetime and location, organize them in your deck, then post them to your domain/wallet for others to view and/or purchase.

After a card is created, you have the option to post, either,


- public
- private limited quantity
- private unlimited quantity


By default, all content posted is publically accessbile, unless specifically marked *private*, meaning it can be viewed by everyone, and directly accessed either through the **Deed/Domain** menu, or by visiting your domain.

Content marked *private* can be viewed anyone, but only after the content has been purchased with **OCUR**. All content posted private requires you specify the amount of **OCUR** to charge.

The editor supports various templates and file attachments to create interactive documents, such as lists, maps, and recipes.
