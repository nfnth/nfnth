### Trade OCUR

**UR.Land** features the ability to trade **OCUR** to trade notes between domains and wallets.

In addition to purchasing content, use **OCUR** to send notes to other domains and/or other wallets. Sent notes can only be viewed by the recipient, and are not publically accessible unless the recipient decides to publisht them.

|**Transaction**|**Description**|**Cost**|
|-|-|-|
|*wallet to wallet*|send message from your wallet to another wallet|10 **OCUR**|
|*wallet to domain*|send message from your wallet to a domain|5 **OCUR**|
|*domain to wallet*|send message from your domain to a wallet|5 **OCUR**|
|*domain to domain*|send message from your domain to another domain|1 **OCUR**|

For example, say you decide to list a product as an NFT on OpenSea. When a client purchases that NFT, they can use **UR.Land** to exchange their address information with you via wallet-to-wallet message or via wallet-to-domain.

Another example is you want to associate your physical address with a wallet address. Purchase a **deed domain** and create a profile with your address for people to view by visiting the domain.

All exchanged notes are validated via signature to guarantee wallet authentication. Although secure message delivery is guaranteed, it is up to the recipient's discretion to not disclose your information.
